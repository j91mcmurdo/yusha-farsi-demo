# Overall Concept: Yusha Farsi Journey

The "Yusha Farsi Journey" app is an interactive tool to aid Yusha's Farsi learning process. It provides a platform for adding, organizing, and viewing Farsi vocabulary and grammar in a visually appealing format, enhanced with AI-powered features to accelerate content creation and improve learning.

## Core Features

- **Hero Section:** A prominent section at the top of the page introduces the project with a placeholder image and descriptive text.
- **Masonry Grid Layout:** The primary method for displaying content is a dynamic masonry grid, which arranges cards of different heights.
- **Interactive Content Cards:** The grid contains different types of cards for 'words', 'phrases', and 'verbs'. 
    - **Audio Playback:** Each card has a speaker icon that plays the Farsi pronunciation of the word or phrase, generated by the ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API. The audio is generated once and cached in Firebase Storage for cost-effective and fast playback.
    - **Verb Conjugations:** Verb cards include an interactive accordion to view conjugations grouped by tense, each with its own audio playback for the entire tense group.
- **In-Page Content Management:** A Floating ActionButton (FAB) with a "speed dial" menu allows for adding new words, phrases, or verbs directly from the main page via a pop-up dialog.
- **AI-Powered Content Generation:** The application uses Genkit to:
    - Automatically translate English/Finglish entries into Farsi script.
    - Suggest the most appropriate category for a new word or phrase.
    - Generate a comprehensive set of conversational, Tehrani-dialect verb conjugations from a single infinitive verb.
- **Lesson-Based Learning:** The app includes a dedicated section for managing lessons, allowing content to be grouped by learning session and "published" to the main grid after review.

## Learning Item Types

The app supports distinct types of learning items to accommodate different aspects of language acquisition:

- **Words:** Individual vocabulary entries, with an optional field for notes.
- **Phrases:** Common expressions or groups of words.
- **Verbs:** Crucial for understanding Farsi grammar, with support for managing and displaying complex conjugations.

## Organization and Filtering

To make the learning content manageable, items are organized using two distinct methods:

- **Categories:** Represent grammatical classifications (e.g., 'Noun', 'Verb', 'General'). Items are filtered by category.
- **Tags:** Represent thematic groupings (e.g., 'Food', 'Animals', 'Colours'). Items can be filtered by tag.

## Styling

The app employs a calm and visually appealing color palette with a light sand background, dark brown text, and accents of sage mint, spearmint, and clay pink. The 'Aref Ruqaa Ink' font is used consistently for both English and Farsi text to maintain a unified look.
